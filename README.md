This is a complete MERN stack project designed to manage notes with real-time updates. For testing purposes, an "Admin" user is provided with the hashed password "123." Notes are stored in a MongoDB database, where they can be created, edited, or deleted. Each note action includes the public IP address, retrieved via an API call to Ipyfi, as an added security measure. This helps maintain a clean and safe testing environment, preventing the creation of inappropriate or offensive content by unauthorized users.

Passport.js with a LocalStrategy is used for authentication. This setup can easily be extended to support OAuth, the industry-standard for authentication, or even social media logins. User sessions are managed using a session secret, while Bcrypt is employed for secure password hashing. CORS is implemented to ensure secure cross-origin resource sharing.

As a MERN stack project, Express.js serves as the backend framework that connects the Node.js server with the React.js frontend, and Mongoose acts as the high-level interface between the server and MongoDB.
